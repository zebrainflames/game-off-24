## TODO

Done:
~~all the starting hackery~~
~~basic platformer controls and collision handling~~
~~level setup~~
~~keys and doors, ending levels~~
~~first version of ninja rope~~
~~palette and first iteration of sprites~~
~~change rendering to use sprites (for player, maybe for tiles)~~
~~simple assets for basic gameplay elements (tiles, doors, key tiles)~~
~~improve rope feel / physics~~

To be done:
- turret (simple art, aiming at player, shooting)
- handling gameplay state, taking damage & death
- more levels to build basic gameplay
- basic sfx
- coyote time?
- timers / scores ?
- menus, switching scenes
- more levels to test physics & game feel
- gems (+N score) ?
- tuning game feel, juice (particle effects on hits, landing, etc. camera shake)
- music or ambient sounds
- better sprites / tiles
- whatever polish time allows for?
- better rope rendering

Scratched from the jam content:
- moving platform
- physics handling that'd reliably prevent tunneling (e.g for rope & turret projectiles)
- one way platform
- more complicated / better art assets
- better level editing & loading or ldTK support
- better rope physics
